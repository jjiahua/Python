# 2. Entrance fees for school plays vary with age. Create a program that will generate a bill for the
# # groups entering the play.
# # o Children under 12 cost $0.50, students under 18 cost $2.50, adults are $5.00 and senior
# # citizens (over 65) are $0.75.
# # o For each group, you will ask for each personâ€™s age.
# # o At the end of each group, display the total cost of the bill, as well as the total cost in
# # each age category.
# # o Make it work for more than one group (similar to question #1).
# # o When there are no more groups, output the total number of people attending the play
# # and the total revenue.
